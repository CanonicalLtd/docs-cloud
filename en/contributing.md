Title: Contributing to documentation

# Contributing to documentation

This documentation is hosted on [GitHub][upstream-github]. Its source documents
are written in standard [GitHub Flavored Markdown][github-gfm] (GFM) format,
which is very easy to work with. Conventions have been added to support
features such as *foldouts* and *admonishments* (explained below).

GFM cheat sheets are available on
[askubuntu.com (editing-help)][gfm-cheatsheet-askubuntu] and
[github.com (Markdown-Cheatsheet)][gfm-cheatsheet-github].

## Documentation bugs

Bugs for documentation issues are submitted here:

https://github.com/CanonicalLtd/docs-cloud/issues/new

and listed here:

https://github.com/CanonicalLtd/docs-cloud/issues

## Contributing to a web page

Here is an overview of what's involved in getting a change published on the website:

1. [Fork][github-help-fork] the
   [documentation repository][github-docs]
1. Clone that fork on your local system
1. Create a branch from your local fork/clone
1. Enter that branch and edit the source documents
1. View the HTML locally
1. Push your branch to your fork (on GitHub)
1. [Create a Pull Request][github-help-pr] for that branch

A documentation team member will review your work, suggest improvements, and
eventually merge it with the appropriate branch (series). Publication to the
website is a separate step (performed internally), so it can be a few days
before the changes actually show up.

### Metadata

Metadata can be included in any file. Currently, this is used for:

- title element
- todo list (file improvements)
- table of contents

This information is written as key:value pairs **at the very top** of the
page. For example:

```no-highlight
Title: Install from ISO
TODO: images need updating when Ubuntu 17.04 is released
      check for changes to bug https://pad.lv/1625211 and modify text accordingly
table_of_contents: True

# Title of document

Text goes here blah blah blah
```

- The TODO items must be left-aligned as shown above.
- The table of contents will contain only level 2 headers.
- The metadata section is terminated by a blank line.

### Sections

Text is organised into sections. These are auto-generated, there is nothing
extra you need to do:

    # Top level header (typically the same as the Title element)
    ## Second level header
    ### Third level header

### Code blocks

Code blocks are created using the code-fencing markup of three backticks,
followed by the type of code:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update 
    sudo apt uppgrade
    ```

The most common *types* used are: `bash`, `yaml`, `json`, and `no-highlight`.

### Inline code

Use a backtick to `inline filenames and other literals` like this:

```no-highlight
Use a backtick to `inline filenames and other literals`.
```

### Admonishments

Admonishments are used to distinguish information from the rest of the text.
They use the following format:

```no-highlight
!!! [admonishment-type] "[title]": 
    [aligned text]
```

Where:

- `admonishment-type` can be 'Note', 'Warning', 'Positive', or 'Negative'.
- `title` is an optional title (visible in HTML)
- `aligned text` is the text

When a value for 'title' is omitted, the default will be the type itself. If
the 'title' has a null value (i.e. "") then no title will be displayed.

#### Admonishment examples

A standard 'Note' type admonishment:

```no-highlight
!!! Note: 
    If KVM-backed nodes are used, ensure that the 'maas' user on the rack
    controller can connect to the KVM host using a passphraseless private SSH
    key.
```

A standard 'Warning' type admonishment:

```no-highlight
!!! Warning: 
    Data will be lost unless you do the right thing.
```

A 'Positive' type admonishment with title:

```no-highlight
!!! Positive "High score":
    A positive note that should include a title.
```

A 'Negative' type admonishment with title:

```no-highlight
!!! Negative "Game over": 
    A negative note that should include a title.
```

A 'Positive' type admonishment with no title:

```no-highlight
!!! Positive "": 
    I'm done, and I feel fine.
```

The above examples will appear as:

!!! Note: 
    If KVM-backed nodes are used, ensure that the 'maas' user on the rack
    controller can connect to the KVM host using a passphraseless private SSH
    key.

!!! Warning: 
    Data will be lost unless you do the right thing.

!!! Positive "High score":
    A positive note that should include a title.

!!! Negative "Game over": 
    A negative note that should include a title.

!!! Positive "": 
    I'm done, and I feel fine.

### Foldouts

When a page contains a lot of extraneous information such as walkthroughs
containing many images or reference tables, a *foldout* can be used. This will
create a collapsed header which, when clicked, will expand to display all the
content below it.

```no-highlight
^# Header
  Content can be multi-paragraphed and will be sent through the Markdown parser

  as long as content is continually indented under the header.
```


### Hyperlinks

Links to internal files or external URLs use the following format:

```no-highlight
[visible text][label]
```

The `visible text` is what will appear on the web page. The `label` is used to
refer to the destination, which is placed at the bottom of the file:

```
<!-- LINKS -->

[label]: destination
```

For example:

```no-highlight
- For more on this topic see [DHCP][dhcp].
- To understand haproxy, see the [upstream configuration manual][upstream-haproxy-manual].

...

[dhcp]: installconfig-networking-dhcp.md
[upstream-haproxy-manual]: http://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/1.6/configuration.html
```

The visible text should use an active style as opposed to a passive style. For
instance, try to avoid:

```no-highlight
A [proxy][maas-proxy] can optionally be configured.
```

Notes:

- An internal page is referred to by its source filename.
- Try to use the same label:destination pair throughout the documentation.


### Images

An image should not be overly cropped - allow for context. When ready, place
the image file in the `media` directory.

In terms of linking, they are managed very similarly to hyperlinks. However,
they are placed on their own line; are preceded by an exclamation point; and
both the label and destination have a specific naming convention:

```no-highlight
![alt attribute][img__webui_descriptor]
```

The bottom of the file will look like:

```no-highlight
[img__webui_descriptor]: ../media/filename__webui_descriptor.png
```

Explanation:

- `filename`: name of file containing the image (omit the extension '.md')
- `webui`: version of software corresponding to the image of the web UI
- `alt attribute`: text that is shown in place of the image if the latter
  cannot be displayed for some reason
- `descriptor`: a short description of the image (e.g. 'enable-dhcp')

For example:

```no-highlight
![enable dhcp][img__2.1_enable-dhcp]
![enable fire alarm][img__enable-fire-alarm]

...

[img__2.1_enable-dhcp]: ../media/installconfig-networking-dhcp__2.1_enable-dhcp.png
[img__enable-fire-alarm]: ../media/installconfig-networking-dhcp__enable-fire-alarm.png
```

If the image is not of versioned software then simply omit the version part,
like in the second image above.

#### Central images directory

For publication (on the web site), all branch series use the `media` directory
in the 'master' branch. This means:

- You must be very careful when renaming or removing an image in master as it
  will affect all non-master branches.
- Any image introduced in a non-master branch must be *forward-ported* to the
  master branch.


## Filenames

The naming of a file is based upon its location in the menu (see below). This
makes it easier for the reader and the writer to build up a mental model of how
the set of pages is structured.

For example, the page corresponding to file `installconfig-network-dhcp.md` is
found under 'Install & Configure' and then 'Networking'.


## Capitalization

Do not use a "Caps Everywhere" style. It is only used in level one headers and
the title metadata. References (visible text) to these page titles (including
the navigation) should just capitalize the first letter. Obviously, this does
not pertain to words that should always be capitalized according to basic
grammar rules (e.g. acronyms, proper nouns).


## Navigation menu

Adding a page (file) to the documentation may require the altering of
`metadata.yaml`. Doing so will insert an entry into the left navigation pane
(the menu) on the website.

This is considered a major change so ensure your PR (pull request) includes a
comment highlighting this change and why it is needed.


## Build and view the HTML

First install the builder. On Ubuntu 16.04 LTS:

```bash
sudo snap install documentation-builder
```

To build the HTML, while in the root of the docs repository:

```bash
/snap/bin/documentation-builder
```

See the [documentation-builder GitHub project][github-documentation-builder]
for details.

You will now need a web server. See the
[Ubuntu Server Guide][ubuntu-serverguide-apache] for instructions on setting up
Apache. The DocumentRoot should be the `build` directory. To test, point your
browser at:

```no-highlight
http://127.0.0.1/en/contributing.html
```

Alternatively, you can use Python to start a simple HTTP server (port 8000).
While in the `build` directory run:

```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

With Python 3:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```


## Style and language

Please follow these guidelines for style and language:

- Resist being overly formal.
- Remember that the average reader is a user, not a developer.
- Use a spell checker.
- Use British English (en-GB). See
  [language details][contributing-en-gb], including a comparison with American
  English (en-US).
- If including links or examples, ensure they actually work.
- Use a maximum of 80 columns for files. Here are instructions for the
  [vim][vim-eighty-columns] and [emacs][emacs-eighty-columns] editors.
- An exception to the above is a link. __Never break a link with a carriage
  return__. This includes the `[text][label]` and `[label]: destination`
  combinations.
